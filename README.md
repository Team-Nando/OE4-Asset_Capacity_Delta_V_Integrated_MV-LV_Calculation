# Assessment of Integrated MV-LV OE Calculations to Orchestrate DERs - OE Algorithm 4: Asset Capacity & Delta Voltage
This repository is part of the project [Accelerating the Implementation of Operating Envelopes Across Australia](https://electrical.eng.unimelb.edu.au/power-energy/projects/accelerating-the-implementation-of-operating-envelopes-across-australia) funded by CSIRO. This project provided key metrics, recommendations, and guidance for distribution companies (known as Distribution Network Service Providers [DNSPs] in Australia) and AEMO (the Australian system operator) to assist them in improving and, hence, accelerating the use of Operating Envelopes (OEs) across Australia.

In this repository, we use interactive code via Jupyter Notebook and Python as well as a [realistic integrated medium voltage and low voltage (MV-LV) network](https://github.com/Team-Nando/MV-LV-Networks) to demonstrate the process and necessary calculations for the *Asset Capacity & Delta Voltage OE Algorithm with Integrated MV-LV Calculation* produced by The University of Melbourne. This demonstration is useful for different stakeholders (e.g., DNSPs, AEMO, CSIRO, regulators, consultancy companies, technology providers) as it can help them familiarise with the corresponding algorithm and the required inputs as well as the pros and cons.

## Asset Capacity & Delta Voltage OE with Integrated MV-LV Calculation
The Asset Capacity & Delta Voltage OE with Integrated MV-LV Calculation is also an intermediate approach  - it is more advanced than the Asset Capacity OE as both voltage and thermal aspects are considered, but less advanced than the Ideal OE - that is still relatively simple to be implemented since it does not need network models and only an extra monitoring (e.g., smart meter, temporary network meter) at the critical customer when compared to the Asset Capacity OE. In this OE approach, thermal issues are solved by estimating the spare capacity of MV and LV networks, while voltages issues are solved by estimating the voltage at the critical customer (using two sensitivity curves) of each LV network. One sensitivity curve (called PMVTx-VDTx sensitivity curve) tries to capture the daily voltage variations at the LV HoF due to interactions with the upstream MV network (not captured by the Asset Capacity & Critical Voltage OE), while the other sensitivity curve (called PDTx-∆V sensitivity curve) tries to estimate the delta voltage between the LV HoF and the critical customer.
- Monitoring: At MV and LV head of feeders (P, Q, and V, all per phase), and at the critical customer of each LV network (voltage magnitude V).
- Electrical models: None.
